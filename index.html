            Crocktus Octagon is an original absurdist noir the likes of which have never been seen. A story featuring the most unreliable
            of narrators: Bruiser McGill, a hard nose P.I. in an outside the box story told by a rag-tag team of dedicated
            losers who think it might finally be their time to shine.

        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p>
            Greetings! Filmic pioneer and cinematic visionary Roderick Crane here to tell you about my latest film (among other things).
            Approximately three years ago I started work on this, my magnum opus: CROCKTUS OCTAGON. That being a surreal
            film-noir starring the delightful Tom Rankin as Planet Earth's most befuddled private eye. To be brutally honest,
            dear reader, I am used to speaking with pictures, not words, but I shall try my best to communicate my story
            and the fundamentals of my cinematic ideology forthwith.
        </p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">It's Hollywood that needs a remake</h3>
        <p>
            To understand the ballad of CROCKTUS OCTOGON, first one really must understand the origins of myself, Roderick Crane: The
            Renowned Director. I highly reccommend you head over to the team profile to find out the journey that has brought
            me here. But for now, onwards to CROCKTUS OCTOGON.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my important time spent developing as an artist, I returned to the land of my birth and was more then horrified by
            the state of Cinema. I was distressed and appalled. My beloved medium was being used and abused as a means of
            crass commerce. Almost all artistic integrity gone and replaced by pure unrestrained capitalistic greed. The
            arthouse films I had grown to love all replaced by crappy franchises, silly remakes of better films, unrealistic
            Superhero dreck and reboots like “Chips” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 The Squeakquel”. I vomited more than
            once at the theater upon my return. Eventually I was able to more thoroughly control my gag reflex, but not before
            I was permanently banned from my local multiplex. Fortunately, the silver lining to this abysmal nightmare was
            my long lost brother, Micro. You see young Micro had decided to pursue a career as an actor, and he had blossomed
            into quite a good one indeed. We connected deeply over that first year, and made a pact: we would make it our
            mission in life to become part of the Hollywood machine so we could effect change from within and save Hollywood
            from itself.
        </p>
        <header class="w3-container w3-padding-32 w3-center w3-black" id="home">
            <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">And then, in the heart of my darkest hour, Bruiser McGill was born.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            After a night of heavy drinking I stumbled out of The Maiden's Iron (my preferred local purveyor of alcoholic beverages).
            I tripped on a fissure in the back alley, where I was relieving myself, and cracked my head on the freshly moist
            concrete. It was then, when I had a dream. A dream of a scraggly, ennui drenched wanderer. A soul out of time.
            A man with long tangled locks, sunglasses and a dour expression that hid a deep longing and pain. He walked briskly,
            his trench coat billowing behind him. A man, clearly on a mission, but for what? Then a voice spoke, and it told
            his tale. He was a man looking. Always looking. Looking for what? Answers. A man destined to search forever always
            looking, but perhaps never to find, the answers for which he sought. The next day while I received 17 stitches
            by a doctor named Brunhilda, I meditated on this morosely tragic hobo-clown.
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, the production of CROCKTUS OCTAGON (thus far) has been an abject failure. Not from an artistic standpoint mind you,
            but certainly from a production standpoint. While I...trust my team. They are no doubt a talented bunch, but
            their lack of commitment has been troubling. You see, I believe great art should have no price tag. I feel that
            they should be so honored to give their time, equipment, talent, and creativity to a great work of cinematic
            art, that no payment should be necessary. Unfortunately they don’t seem to agree. While they have agreed to help
            me when their schedules permit, free of charge, this pace has simply proven too lethargic to continue for this
            feature length cinematic journey. I must complete CROCKTUS OCTAGON for it shall be my masterpiece. A brilliant
            work of visionary genius that will show Hollywood once and for all that their salvation lies within original
            film and not in all these nambie-pambie remakes, reboots, and stories of men (and women) who can lift heavy objects
            (with their hands, minds, or whatever). Anyway, I was faced with yet another conundrum: How was I to pay my cast
            and crew?
        </p>
        <p>
            Dearest reader, I am a humble film artist, but I have never been able to find steady work outside of my passion. I’ve floated
            from day job to day job, and am currently employed as a head custodial engineer. And while, yes, that title does
            certainly befit a man of my stature, it barely varnishes me with the funds necessary to keep a roof over my head,
            let alone pay my demanding troupe of cinematic tradesmen (and tradeswomen). I turned once again to the bottle.
            Having slipped back into alcoholism because of my team’s outrageous demands, I also developed a not insignificant
            addiction to hylosinogenics*.

            <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Until one night during a week long peyote binge, I had another important dream...</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            There was a woman, she was standing atop the empire state building, calling down to me on the street. She was screaming at
            me, but I could not make out her meaning. Inside my heart I knew what she was yelling was of vital import, so
            I flew to her post-haste. When I reached the viewing deck, there she was: her face glowing bright like an angel.
            As she grew closer I could feel the heat from her face melt my eyes out of their sockets. She grew closer still
            until everything but my skeleton had been roasted away. She grew even closer until her lips almost touched the
            place where my ears had been, before you know, she burned them off with her radiance or whatever. Then she whispered
            a word. A single word...
        </p>

        <p>
            I was reluctant at first to take the glowing ladies advice, but after our next shoot was a failure of sizable proportions
            I figured, what the hell? So about a month ago I began upon the arduous task of beginning our campaign. I quickly
            learned it wouldn’t be anywhere near as easy as I expected, but no matter. After having faced countless problems,
            delay after delay my burning desire to finish CROCKTUS OCTAGON is hotter than ever. As I’ve said, my impatience
            waiting to share my vision with the world grows stronger everyday. It’s exhausting, really. So, here I am, hat
            in hand, a brilliant humble vagabond, ever so graciously asking for your help. So dearest viewer, will you help
            us? Or will you let Hollywood damn us to the cultural hell of endless transformer movies?

        <p>
            It's incredibly important for us to foster the spirit of independent film making, especially in kids who aren't typically
            given a chance to do so. We will be working with local, low-income and inner city high schools to give teenagers
            a chance to be on set with us and cultivate their creativity.
